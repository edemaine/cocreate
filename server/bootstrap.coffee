  When this conversion code was written, the width assignment was between
  50% and 150% of target width, and allowed target widths are all integers.
  So the average between the min and max width we see, rounded to the nearest
  integer, is a good estimator for the true width.  Anyway, we don't have to
  be perfect; this is just to make the widths editable if desired.
