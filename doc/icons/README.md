# Cocreate Documentation Icons

Most of these icons are generated automatically from
[icons.coffee](../../client/lib/icons.coffee) via the
[make.coffee](make.coffee) script.

To run the script (e.g., when an icon changes or is added):

```sh
npm run doc:icons
```

A few icons are drawn manually:

* `rainbow.svg` based on `#customColor` CSS
* `arrow-start.svg` and `arrow-end.svg` based on `client/tools/arrow.coffee`
* `dash-*.svg` based on `client/tools/dash.coffee`
